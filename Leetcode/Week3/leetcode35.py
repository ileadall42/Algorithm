# Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
#
# You may assume no duplicates in the array.
#
# Here are few examples.
# [1,3,5,6], 5 → 2
# [1,3,5,6], 2 → 1
# [1,3,5,6], 7 → 4
# [1,3,5,6], 0 → 0
#可以用二分查找 查找不到的哪一个临界点就 插入  只需返回index
